# About Me

Hi, I’m **Niall Carbery** – a passionate third-year Theoretical Physics student at University College Dublin with a deep love for exploring the intersections of science, technology, and data. My journey is defined by a curiosity for solving complex problems and a commitment to sustainability, innovation, and continuous learning.

## Academic & Professional Journey

- **Theoretical Physics & Data Science:**  
  Currently pursuing a BSc (Hons) in Theoretical Physics at UCD, I have immersed myself in subjects ranging from Quantum Mechanics and Thermodynamics to Data Analysis and Partial Differential Equations. In parallel, I’m self-teaching Data Science and Analytics, which enhances my ability to tackle diverse challenges through computational methods.

- **Cutting-Edge Projects:**  
  I have spearheaded projects in quantum computing and advanced computational science. My work includes developing a water-saving canal timetabling algorithm using quantum optimization techniques, and designing machine learning models enhanced with quantum kernels. These experiences have honed my skills in Python, Mathematica, SQL, and various scientific libraries.

- **Industry Experience:**  
  As a Data Analytics Intern at SSE Airtricity, I contributed to implementing regulatory data governance frameworks and advanced AI solutions. Additionally, my background as a tutor in Physics and Mathematics has strengthened my ability to communicate complex ideas effectively.

## Skills & Tools

I am proficient in:
- **Programming & Analysis:** Python, C, R, SQL, and Mathematica  
- **Scientific Computing:** NumPy, SciPy, SKLearn  
- **Quantum Computing:** Qiskit, Quimb  
- **Algorithm Design & Data Analytics**

## Beyond the Lab

When I’m not delving into complex algorithms or developing innovative projects, I channel my energy into athletics. As an active middle-distance runner with Clonliffe Harriers AC, I have achieved national and international recognition in cross country and steeplechase events. My dedication to sports mirrors my approach to academics and professional challenges – always striving for excellence and pushing the limits.

## Let’s Connect

I’m always open to discussing innovative projects, research collaborations, or even a chat about the latest in quantum computing and data science. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niallcarbery/) or check out my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/NiallCarbery).
